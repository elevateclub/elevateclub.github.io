    <p>
    From Novice Cadet to Ultra Black Belt, 9 athletes and families flew out to Fort Lauderdale, FL as
    Team Wolfpack, representing New York Black Belt Center, to compete at the AAU Taekwondo National Championships.
    After months, years, and for some, decades, of tireless training, every competitor showed up to demonstrate the results of their hard work.
